# *Project name*
*Project name*  is a C++ - python TCP socket application for video streaming and executing commands in the server side of the project

## TODO List
1 - Fix debug printouts, make a standard for debug prints and maybe change/add color? *something like "[DEBUG] something!" for all functions that have a debug option*

2 - Assign better names to varaibles, make a standard for variable names in the C++ side of the code and a another standart for the python side

3 - Add comments that explain what the code is doing, like at the start of each function

4 - Make the change from TCP stream socket to UDP stream *how did i miss this?*

5 - For the client side of the code, implement a gui (ImGUI library or others)
